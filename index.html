                    My name is Ian Sawyer, I'm from North Vernon, Indiana, a small town on the southern end of the state.
                     Some of my hobbies are sports, playing the guitar, weight-lifting, and videogames. Some 
                    hobbies that I am interested in pursuing are woodworking and fixing cars! I typically enjoy 
                    working with my hands a lot when I'm not coding; however, I've not had the means to pursue these hobbies due to a lack of time, accessibility, 
                    and engaging in other hobbies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As for my professional life, I am a student of computer science at Rose-Hulman Insititute of Technology. A list of my skills 
                    would include working with a team, finding information, and of course programming. Languages that i am familiar with are Python, 
                    C, Java, and HTML/CSS. I'm particularly fond of working with C, and I would quite like to learn more regarding lower-level 
                    programming, like embedded systems.
